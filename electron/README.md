# sushipool-electron-miner

A desktop Electron GUI to mine [Nimiq](https://nimiq.com), a browser-based cryptocurrency, developed for [Sushipool](https://sushipool.com).

## To Use

**TODO: it seems that we need to use Node.js 8.0 to make this GUI work? Can we use more recent versions?**

> First install nvm from https://github.com/creationix/nvm to let you run multiple Node.js versions in parallel. Activate Node.js version 8 using the command: `$ nvm use 8`, and follow the steps below.

To run this repository, enter the following from your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Sushipool/source.git
# Go into the Electron directory
